My game will entail a plane that is flying through a cave. The plane is moving not to fast at the beginning but overtime it speeds up. The cave has a curvy roof and curvy bottom that will get increasingly big curves making it harder and harder overtime. You will only move the plane up and down with the up and down arrows. It will stay in place while the canvas caves move on. When you hit one of the caves the plane explodes and game over. You may restart with space bar after.
